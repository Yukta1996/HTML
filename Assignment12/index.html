    <h1 id="mk">Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <p id="mkg">
        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was  was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, 
        and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent <span class="color">resistance to lead</span> the successful campaign
        for India's independence from British rule,and in turn inspired movements for civil rights 
        and freedom across the world.Assuming lead<span class="color">ership of the Indian N</span>ational Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, 
        building religious and ethnic amity, ending un<span class="color">touchability, and above all f</span>or achieving Swaraj or self-rule.
    </p>
    <p id="gandhi">
        Gandhi was influenced by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and
        <span class="color">saint tradition which co-existed with</span>  Jain tradition in Gujarat.<br>Gandhi dedicated his life to discovering
        and <span class="color">pursuing truth, or Satya,and called his </span>movement satyagraha,<br> which means "appeal to, insistence on,
        or reliance on <span class="color">the Truth".
            The essence of Satyagraha is "soul force"</span>  as a political means,<br> refusing to use brute force against the oppressor,
         <span class="color">seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor</span> and the oppressed,<br> aiming to transform or "purify" the oppressor. It is not 
        inaction but determ<span class="color">ined passive resistance and non-co-operation where,</span> states Arthur Herman, <br>"love conquers hate".

<h2>His popular sayings!</h2>
<p id="quote">
    # An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.<br>
    #  Where there is love there is life.<br>
    #  In a gentle way, you can shake the world.<br>
    #  If you don't ask, you don't get it.<br>
    #  Hate the sin, love the sinner.<br>
    #  Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.<br>
    #  Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed.<br>
</p>

   <h2>His search for truth</h2>
       <p id="truth">He believed that " To find Truth completely is to realize oneself and one's destiny, i.e., to become perfect."
       He was but a seeker after Truth.He claimed to have found a way to it. He claim to be making a ceaseless 
       effort to find it. But he admit that he has not yet found it. 
       <br>
       He said that:"I claim to have no infallible guidance or inspiration. So far as my experience goes, 
       the claim to infallibility on the part of a human being would be untenable, seeing that inspiration 
       too can come only to one who is free from the action of opposites, and it will be difficult to judge 
       on a given occasion whether the claim to freedom from pairs of opposites is justified. The claim to 
       infallibility would thus always be a most dangerous claim to make. This, however, does not leave us
        without any guidance whatsoever. The sum-total of the experience of the world is available to us and
         would be for all time to come.
