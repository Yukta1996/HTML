            Bharatanatyam, also previously called Sadira Attam, is a major form of Indian classical dance that is 
            indigenous to Tamil Nadu. Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance traditions in India. 
            Bharatnatyam is a solo, feminine type of a dance, which is tender and erotic. The basic theme is love, where the female dancers usually perform as a devotion to the Supreme Being; or love of a mother for child. It epitomizes the adoration of lovers separated and reunited.
            It was nurtured in the temples and courts of southern India since ancient times. It is one of eight 
            forms of dance recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi and it expresses South Indian religious themes 
            and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.
            Natya Shastra is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE.

            Kathak is one of the eight forms of Indian classical dances, originated from India. 
            This dance form traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as 
            Kathakars or storytellers. Its form today contains traces of temple and ritual dances, and the 
            influence of the bhakti movement. From the 16th century onwards it absorbed certain features of 
            Persian dance and central Asian dance . The name of the dance is derived from Sanskrit which means story.
            The classical dances can be compared to the ballet dances. These dances are very complicated and usually
            have a meaning to them. Just like the name, they are supposed to tell some sort of a story.

        <p class="eight">
            Tap dance is a form of dance characterized by a tapping sound that is created from metal plates that are 
            attached to both the ball and heel of the dancer’s shoe. Special shoes are made for dancing the tap. 
            These metal plates, when tapped against a hard surface, create a percussive sound and as such the dancers 
            are considered to be musicians. Tap dance has roots in African American dancing such as the Juba Dance, 
            English Lancashire Clog dancing, and probably most notably Irish stepdancing. It is believed to have begun 
            in the mid-1800s during the rise of minstrel shows.
