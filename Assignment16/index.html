        Noddy is a fictional character created by English children's author Enid Blyton, originally published between 1949 and 1963. Noddy was illustrated by the Dutch artist Eelco Martinus ten Harmsen van der Beek from 1949 until his death in 1953, after which the work was continued by Peter Wienk.
        Television shows based on the character have run on British television since 1955.

        Noddy is kind and honest, but he often gets in trouble, either through his own misunderstandings, 
        or because someone, usually one of the naughty goblins Sly or Gobbo, has played a trick on him. 
        He is very childlike in his understanding of the world and often becomes confused as a result. 
        For example, in the first Noddy book, Noddy and Big Ears are building Noddy's house for one.
        Noddy suggests that they build the roof first, in case it rains. With no understanding of gravity 
        or of the need for roof supports, this is perfectly logical to him. As the series continues,
        Noddy becomes wiser but without losing his charm and lovable naivety.

    <p id="third">
        Noddy's best friends are Big Ears, Tessie Bear, Bumpy Dog, and the Tubby Bears. Big Ears, who brought
        Noddy to Toyland, is the most important figure in his life. Whenever he faces serious peril, it tends
        to be Big Ears who comes to the rescue, one way or another, and it is invariably Big Ears to whom Noddy 
        turns for support and reassurance. Big Ears is not so much a parental figure, but more like a guardian,
        or perhaps Noddy's attorney. While kind to Noddy, Big Ears has an intimidating presence and voice that
        makes him feared by goblins. He is capable of facing down wizards with his own spells, and is able to
        plead Noddy's case to Mr. Plod, the local policeman, when Noddy finds himself in legal peril. On rare
        occasions, however, Big Ears finds himself in trouble, in which case Noddy comes to his aid. Big Ears
        and Noddy have rarely quarreled seriously. Examples of such quarrels are when Big Ears harshly scolded
        the very sensitive Tessie Bear for failing to control her dog and when Noddy ran his car into Big 
        Ears's clothes post and then drove away, dragging Big Ears's clean washing behind him.
